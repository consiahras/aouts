#SOCKETS IN PYTHON
#Python has a build-in support for TCP sockets and it only has 3 lines
#socket.SOCK_STREAM means we expect a series of strings to coming back
#SOS this is like dialing the Phone, doesnt means the connection is made
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET , socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
