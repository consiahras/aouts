#List comprehensions : provide a concise way to create lists. 
#Its a fast way to create lists by filtering it as well , for example you want to create
#SYNTAX :  *result* =  [*Transofer value*       *iteration*      *filter we want to apply (if we want*)]
x=[i for i in range(10)]
print(x)
#but lets say we want to create i**2, we can do it with 2 ways : 
squares=[]
for y in range(10): 
    squares.append(y**2)    
print(squares)
#or we can use list comprehensions to get same resukt
squares2=[z**2 for z in range(10)]
print(squares2)
#Example of filter , print only even
skata=[x**2 for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
print(skata)

#Exersice List comprehensions
#git testing to push
