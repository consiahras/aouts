#We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).
#Let's try to understand this with an example.
#You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it.
#example : >>> string = "abracadabra"
#>>> print string[5] ==> a
#to change the a --> k one solution is make this string a list and change the valie
#Another approach is to slice the string and join it back.
#>>> string = string[:5] + "k" + string[6:]
#sample input
#abracadabra
# 5 k
