#Regular Expressions are really old concept 
#its kind of an "old school" language

#  ^   means the beginning of a line
#  $   means tge end of the line
#  .   means any character
#  \s  matches whitespace
#  \S matches any non-whitespace character
#  *   Repeats a character zero or more times
#  *?  Repeats a character zero or more times (non greedy) - Greedy means when you find 1st time the character not 2nd
#in cases that you have the character you are looking for many times.
#  +  Repeats a character zero or more times
#  +?  Repeats a character zero or more times(non-greedy)
#  [aeiou]  Matcges a single character in the listed set
#  [^XYZ]   matches a single character NOT in the listed set
#  [a-z0-9] tge set if cgaracters cab include a range
#  (   Indicates where string extraction is to start
#  )   Indicates where string extraction is to end
# [0-9]+ means we want to get a number from 0-9 at least 1



#To be able to use regex you need to import libray using "import re"
#you can use re.search() to see if a string matches a regular expression , similar to the find()  method for strings
#You can use re.findall() to extract portions of a string that match your regular expression, similar to find() and slicing
# var[5:10]
import re
fhand=open('/Users/konstantinossiachras/Desktop/Python Scripting/skata.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line=line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From:' , line):
        print(line)



#EXTRACTING DATA
import re
x='My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
y=re.findall('[0-9]+',x)
print(y)
#it returns list of strings(not numbers!!!)




#to extract data we use the () 
#so for example: stuff=re.findall('^X-DSPAM-Confidence: ([0-9.]+)') , line)
#will extract only the numbers and not the text befre

import re
hand=open('/Users/konstantinossiachras/Desktop/Python Scripting/skata.txt')
numlist=list()
for line in hand:
    line=line.rstrip()
    stuff=re.findall('^X-DSPAM-Confidence: ([0-9.]+)' , line)
    if len(stuff) !=1 : continue
    num=float(stuff[0])
